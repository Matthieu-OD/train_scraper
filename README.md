# TRAIN SCRAPER

This is an application that will allow TGV MAX subscribers to get notify when they can have free tickets on train they selected.

It's a micro-services app developed with :
  - Golang for the backend
  - Python for the scraper
  - Svelte (JS) for the frontend
  - Postgres for the DB (might change)

This is not an open source application.
